# ft_transcendence
The final Codam Common Core project. 

As of right now:

	Both the frontend and backend folders contain scripts that should reliably start them up at any imac at codam
	However, i needed to use a --force flag at one point to get past dependency errors we need to solve asap
	
	Backend (NestJS API) currently contains a first controller for /users. You can request all users by
	sending a GET request to http://localhost:3000/users or a single user by sending a GET request to 
	http://localhost:3000/users/[id].
