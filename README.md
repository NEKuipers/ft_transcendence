# ft_transcendence
The final Codam Common Core project. 

As of right now:

	Both the frontend and backend folders contain scripts that should reliably start them up at any imac at codam
	However, i needed to use a --force flag at one point to get past dependency errors we need to solve asap
	They're not connected yet, backend is at port 3000 and front at 8080 right now
	Still, usable jumping off point for everyone to try some stuff with i guess
